                    <h1>About Me</h1>
                    <p>As a 2nd year Computer Science student at Liberty University, I am passionate about using technology to solve complex problems and make a meaningful impact. Through my studies and hands-on projects, I have built a strong foundation in React.js, Node.js, Python, Java, C++, SQL, and NoSQL.</p>

                    <p>This summer, I am excited to be interning at Cardinal Health on their Sonexus team, where I will be working with C#/ASP.NET, Azure, and other technologies to develop patient-focused healthcare technology.</p>
                        
                    <p>I am always eager to connect with fellow technology professionals, exchange ideas, and explore new opportunities for learning and growth. Feel free to reach out!</p>
   
                    <h2>My Journey</h2>
                    <p>I originally began my academic journey as a pre-pharmacy major, driven by a passion for science and a desire to make a difference. Along the way, I discovered a growing interest with technology - how it shapes the world and solves problems. That curiosity led me to pivot and pursue a degree in Computer Science at Liberty University. Since then, I've had a good opportunity to be a Software Engineer Intern for a small startup while constantly learning in and out of school, and I am going to be interning at Cardinal Health(Fortune 14) this summer.</p>
                    
                    
                    <h2>My Approach</h2>
                    <p>I believe in clean, maintainable code and user-centered design. Every project I take on begins with understanding the unique needs and goals of my clients, followed by careful planning and execution to ensure the final product exceeds expectations.</p>
                    
                    <h2>When I'm Not Coding</h2>
                    <p>Outside of work, I enjoy playing guitar, working out, and listening to music, watching movies, hanging out with my girlfriend, and hanging out with my friends.</p>
